# About the project:

The Movie System is a personal project using **Rust** and **WebAssembly** to help choose what movie to watch. This project is under active development, but still quite a ways from being functional.

Mostly, this is just for fun and a cool way to learn more about Rust and web development through doing.

# How The Movie System Works
My girlfriend and I watch a lot of movies. And, at times it can be difficult to agree on what to watch. Originally, we would take turns picking, but I quickly figured out she either picks terrible movies or something I’ve already watched. So, I devised a system to help choose what to watch.

The original system is as follows:  First, we both open IMDB tabs of potential movies to watch. Next, we take turns to browse the open tabs and veto a single movie and close that browser tab. This goes back and forth with each of us closing tabs until a single movie remains and that’s what we watch.

In general, the system works and this project aims to translate it into a webapp with some extra features for tracking watched movies and evaluating the effectiveness of the system.
